Kuruzhleng has a number of noun cases.

Nominative is formed by the prefix ol-.
It most often marks the agent of a sentence in the modern language but was limited to referring to the subject in the ancient forms.

Accusative is formed by hr-. This is actualized as an unvoiced r most often.
Like the nominative, it began marking only the grammatical object but morphed over time into marking of the patient.

Genitive is formed with ku-. It inflects the possessor of the object or quality.

Dative is formed with tenn-.

Instrumental is formed by bos-. It is applied to the (always non-agentive) instrument of an action. If you have a case where you have to choose between instrumental and nominative, use nominative.

Locative is formed by rii-. It signifies that the happenings of a sentence occur within the marked noun.
Rii is also a separate word meaning "in", for those times where you want that.

Allative is formed with voi-. It signifies motion towards an object, or being at the edge of something. One common usage is to mean "upon", in a somewhat ephemeral sense.


Ablative is formed by vau-. It signifies motion away.
