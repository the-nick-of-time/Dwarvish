"ai", "ei", "oi", "ui" are i-glide diphthongs.
"ii" is instead /i/.

If there are two of the same vowel in a row, a glottal stop is inserted between them (except for i, which follows the divergent rule above).

Unless a word consists of only one syllable, it cannot begin with a vowel or semivowel.

The combination sj is often actualized as 'sh', though this is not to be desired.

If there would exist a "uo" cluster, the 'u' is dropped.

The 'f'->'th'/'v'->'dh' change introduced by the humans happens before frony vowels and word-finally. If the sound stops being word-final due to the addition of suffixes, the sound reverts to 'f' or 'v'. This change is often omitted by new speakers and has been gaining inertia.

'n' can never happen before a velar, while 'ng' can never happen before a front vowel.

The "hh" cluster becomes instead "xh".

An "rr" cluster becomes a trilled 'r'.
