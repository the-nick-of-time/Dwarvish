DERIVATIONAL
Derivational affixes are evaluated from the inside out.

-da is used on any other word to produce a noun.
	verb tekta "live" -> noun tektada "life"
	verb
	adjective mæltjom "serene" -> noun mæltjomda "serenity" 

-tsom forms an adjective from a noun. If you wish to make an adjective from a verb, you need to first transform it to a noun using -da.
The produced adjectives can vary from extremely literal to abstract. Most often the adjective deals with the core or most recognizable feature of the original object.
	noun çel "beauty" -> adjective çeltsom "beautiful"
	noun kva "water" -> adjective kvatsom "wet"
	verb tsumt "think" -> adjective tsumdatsom "deliberate (describing a person)"

-vha produces a verb from another part of speech. The interpretation of the result is usually "to bring *x* to pass".


INFLECTIONAL
If there are multiple types of affixes on one word, inflections are applied last.

vii- is the negative affix. It can be freely applied to verbs and adjectives, producing exactly the words you would expect.
Applying it to a noun instead most often produces an adjective.
	verb kraukh "change" -> verb viikraukh "stagnate"
	verb reŋkla	"sleep" -> verb viireŋkla	"wake"
	adjective mjaa "good" -> adjective viimjaa "not good"
	noun del "sound" -> adjective viidel "silent"


EXAMPLES
verb sulvket "bend" -> adjective sulvketsom "flexible" -> adjective viisulvketsom "rigid"
